<h1> Musical Review Database Development </h1>

<h3> Description </h3>

Group project with introductory data science course for MS in Applied Data Science Program, focusing on gaining business insight into hotel cancellations. Because this was an introductory programming course, the desired output was extremely open-ended, meaning this project was a chance to explore potential methods in R that would be covered in later courses.

The components which I contributed to the project are found in the problem development sections, where I was responsible for formulating business questions then code models to develop analytical insights. My work is best expressed in pages 15-29 of the report, where I demonstrated several methods and potential insights that I explored. Furthermore, I dedicated my time to the overall project report delivery, meaning most of the written communication came from me. I also compiled and organized our individual works into the final code, LaTeX report, and a large portion of the presentation.

Because the project has a large amount of information, it is recommended to look over pages 15-29 of the report to view my input. The rest of the report, attached code, and presentation are also available for reference. Navigating the github page, the corresponding files links are below:
